metastore
=========

metastore is a tool to store the metadata of files/directories/links in
a file tree to a separate file and to later compare and apply the stored
metadata to said file tree.

It was written as a supplement to git which does not store all metadata,
making it unsuitable for e.g. storing /etc in a repository.

metastore can also be helpful if you want to create a tarball of a file
tree and make sure that "everything" (e.g. xattrs, mtime, owner, group)
is stored along with the files.


Stored metadata
---------------

metastore stores following metadata in its files:

- owner,
- group,
- permissions,
- xattrs,
- mtime - optionally.


Usage
-----

See man1/metastore.1 file, which is the manual page.


File format
-----------

See FILEFORMAT file, which describes internals of metastore file.


Requirements
------------

- Linux
- GNU make
- C99 compiler, like gcc or clang
- libbsd


Building
--------

Simply run `make` from project's root directory.

Building out-of-tree is supported out-of-the-box. Go to your chosen
build directory and run there:

    $ make -f path/to/metastore/Makefile


Installation
------------

Run `make install`.  Default settings for installation are:

     PREFIX      = /usr/local
     EXECPREFIX  = ${PREFIX}           (/usr/local)
     BINDIR      = ${EXECPREFIX}/bin   (/usr/local/bin)
     DATAROOTDIR = ${PREFIX}/share     (/usr/local/share)
     MANDIR      = ${DATAROOTDIR}/man  (/usr/local/share/man)

You can always change them, e.g.:

    $ make install PREFIX=/usr

DESTDIR is also supported.
